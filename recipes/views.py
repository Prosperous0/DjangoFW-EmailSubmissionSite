🍝 PASTA CARBONARA RECIPE 🍝

INGREDIENTS (Serves 4):
- 400g spaghetti
- 200g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente.

2. While pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat.

3. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, cheese, and plenty of black pepper.

4. When pasta is done, reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain pasta.

5. Add hot pasta to the skillet with pancetta. Toss quickly.

6. Remove from heat and immediately add egg mixture, tossing vigorously to create a creamy sauce. Add pasta water as needed for desired consistency.

7. Serve immediately with extra cheese and black pepper.

PRO TIP: The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs without scrambling them!
